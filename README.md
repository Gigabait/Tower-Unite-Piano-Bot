# How to use
1. Read Known issues and Important
2. Paste the song you want to play in the text box
3. Make sure the song is a appropriate format and does not contain special characters
4. Make sure your in-game character is sitting by the piano 
5. Click play
6. If the game window does not become the active window on its own, do so now

An example of a working input is as such:

A B C ABC [ABC] {ABC}

An example of invalid input is as such:

(x2) (x3) etc.

as described in Known issues.

# Planned features

Suggestions?

# Known issues
Cannot play black keys. (This has since been fixed in later versions, see master branch)

Does not support (x2) etc. tags. The workaround is to paste it for each iteration.

These issues may lead to the software crashing or the in game character leaving the piano (See "Important").

# Important
The software will send keypresses to the game until it completes the sequence or the stop button is pressed.

This means that if you leave the piano prematurely it WILL continue to send keypresses!

Use the software at your own risk.
