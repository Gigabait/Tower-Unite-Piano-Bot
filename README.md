as described in Known issues.

# Planned features

Suggestions?

# Known issues
Cannot play black keys. (This is fixed in later versions on master branch)

Does not support (x2) etc. tags. The workaround is to paste it for each iteration.

These issues may lead to the software crashing or the in game character leaving the piano (See "Important").

The software will send keypresses to the game until it completes the sequence or the stop button is pressed.
This means that if you leave the piano prematurely it WILL continue to send keypresses!

Use the software at your own risk.
