# Planned features
Saving and loading songs

# Known issues
Some characters are not supported as notes, yet (Mostly special characters).
Does not support (x2) etc. tags. The workaround is to paste it for each iteration.

These issues may lead to the software crashing or the in game character leaving the piano (See "Important").

# Important
The software will send keypresses to the game until it completes the sequence or the stop button is pressed.
This means that if you leave the piano prematurely it WILL continue to send keypresses!
Use the software at your own risk.
